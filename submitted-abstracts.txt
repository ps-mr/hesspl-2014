Title:
Abstract dependent classes.

Abstract:
Software reuse provides means to combine existing components to
implement new functionalities. Dependent Classes are a powerful solution that
combines a lot of desirable features, including dynamic composition,
feature selection and static type checking.

However, several research questions are still open. An important
issue is that many interesting applications of Dependent Classes
involve the use of abstract classes. However the calculus of Dependent Classes
does not support them. Type checking of abstract
declarations for dependent classes is challenging, because it
requires completeness and uniqueness checks for classes dispatched
by dependent types. We envisage that the existing calculus of
Dependent Classes can support abstract classes, show the changes that
are necessary and provide a roadmap for further research in the
field.
